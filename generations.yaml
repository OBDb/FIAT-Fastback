    description: "The Fiat Fastback is a compact SUV coupe developed specifically for South American markets, particularly Brazil. Built on Fiat's MLA platform shared with the Pulse compact SUV, it features distinctive coupe-like styling with a sloping roofline combined with traditional SUV elements including plastic body cladding and raised ride height. The exterior design incorporates Fiat's current design language with slim LED headlights, a wide grille, and a muscular stance. Measuring approximately 4.43 meters in length, it's positioned as a more stylish, premium offering compared to the smaller Pulse. Powertrain options include a 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 130 HP in base models, and a more powerful 1.3L turbocharged four-cylinder delivering 185 HP in higher-end variants, both paired with a CVT automatic transmission with simulated gear shifts. The interior features a driver-focused cockpit with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 7-inch digital instrument display, and improved materials compared to Fiat's lower-cost offerings. Practicality is maintained despite the coupe roofline, with a 600-liter trunk capacity. The Fastback represents Fiat's response to the growing trend of SUV coupes, previously limited mostly to premium brands, bringing this body style to a more accessible price point in emerging markets. It also demonstrates the brand's strategy of developing specific models tailored to regional preferences rather than relying solely on global platforms."
