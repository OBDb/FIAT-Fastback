    description: "The Fiat Fastback is a subcompact coupe SUV produced by Fiat mainly for the South American market, released in August 2022. It is the coupe SUV version of the Fiat Pulse and is based on the same MLA platform. In Brazil, it is positioned as a flagship Fiat model only below the imported Fiat 500e. The vehicle is assembled in Betim, Minas Gerais, Brazil. It features distinctive coupe-like styling with a sloping roofline combined with traditional SUV elements including plastic body cladding and raised ride height. Measuring approximately 4.43 meters (4,427 mm) in length and 1.77 meters (1,774 mm) in width, with a height of 1.55 meters (1,545 mm), it combines SUV practicality with coupe aesthetics. Powertrain options include a 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 130 HP on ethanol (125 HP on gasoline) in base models, and a more powerful 1.3L turbocharged four-cylinder delivering 185 HP on ethanol (182 HP on gasoline) in higher-end variants. Both engines are flex-fuel capable and produce 200 Nm and 270 Nm of torque respectively. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic or CVT. The interior features a driver-focused cockpit with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system and 7-inch digital instrument display. The vehicle also comes with safety features including LED lighting, automatic high beam, tire pressure monitoring, hill holder, traction control, ESC, lane departure warning, and collision avoidance system. The Fastback is also available as the Abarth Fastback performance variant."
